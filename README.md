# 🧠 Simon Game (jQuery Project)

This is a browser-based **Simon Game clone** built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It's a memory challenge where the user must replicate an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds. Built for learning and practicing **DOM manipulation, event handling**, and **basic game logic** using jQuery.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the flashing color sequence.
3. Click the buttons in the same order.
4. With each level, the sequence gets longer.
5. Make a mistake? The game will reset and let you try again.
